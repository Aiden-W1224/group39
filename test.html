		<p>We plan to create a hospital management system particularly for emergency rooms that keeps track of nurses/doctors that are free, patients that have yet to be checked up on and their ailments, injuries, current medications, etc. Keeping track of which staff are free will help get waiting patients the help they need. Additionally, patients will be able to use the system ahead of time (perhaps before even leaving the scene of the injury) to see which hospitals are busiest and plan their trip to the ER accordingly. Keeping track of the patient’s medical history (injuries, current medications, etc) will help speed up their diagnosis by getting some preliminary questions out of the way. Additionally, because a patient’s information will be tied to their Health Card number, it would
follow them in all hospitals in Canada.</p>
